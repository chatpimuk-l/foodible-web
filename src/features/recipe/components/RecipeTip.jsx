        You guys know how I love using leftover odds and ends in my fridge to
        make delicious meals on the fly, right? Well these tasty little eggs
        baked in a tortilla shell are my newest obsession. You can toss just
        about any meat or cheese into these Tortilla Baked Eggs to come up with
        your own tasty creation. Sounds like a fun Saturday morning project to
        me!
